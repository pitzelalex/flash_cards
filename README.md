#  Flash Cards

This is the starter repository for the [Flash Cards](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/flashcards) project.

## Description

This is my completed flash_cards solo project. You can run the file by running flashcard_runner.rb. 

You can add your own questions by editing cards.txt. Follow the format for the questions and answers exactly or it can break the program.
